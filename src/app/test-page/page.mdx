# About Me

I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong commitment to building impactful digital solutions. With hands-on experience in designing and deploying robust, user-centered web applications, I specialize in using modern tools and frameworks like React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and Prisma to create high-quality applications that are as functional as they are visually engaging. I have a track record of developing full-stack applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experience. For instance, Run, my online code editor, empowers users to code and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a browser environment with real-time and offline saving capabilities. Organi, my e-commerce platform, provides seamless shopping experiences, integrating secure payment solutions and a dynamic catalog powered by a public API. I've also developed real estate applications that connect buyers and sellers, leveraging full-stack capabilities to build a reliable and scalable platform. I'm motivated by the impact that well-crafted software can have, whether it's increasing a client’s reach or providing practical solutions for daily tasks. Beyond technical skills, I bring a deep understanding of the value of seamless user experiences and efficient, maintainable code. As I continue to grow my expertise, my vision is to create a tech startup that addresses fundamental business challenges with innovative software solutions. In the near future, I also plan to enhance my portfolio with an AI-powered assistant, enabling visitors to interact and learn more about my work dynamically. If you're looking for someone who is passionate about transforming ideas into actionable, results-driven applications, I'd love to connect!

### Nest - Real Estate App

Nest is a fully functional, user-friendly real estate web app that connects potential buyers with sellers, simplifying the process of browsing properties and facilitating smooth communication between parties. Built to deliver a seamless experience, the app leverages a carefully selected tech stack, including TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Zod, Express, MongoDB, and Prisma.

### Tech Stack and Infrastructure

- **Frontend**: Built with **React.js** and **Next.js**, the app benefits from Next.js’s server-side rendering capabilities, which optimize load times and improve SEO—a critical factor in real estate sites where users need immediate property results. **TypeScript** ensures type safety across the project, preventing bugs and making the codebase more maintainable.

- **Validation**: The app uses **Zod** for efficient schema validation, which ensures data consistency from the frontend through to the backend, leading to more robust API requests and form submissions.

- **Backend**: **Express.js** serves as the backend framework, where endpoints handle data requests, user actions, and manage connections to the database. **MongoDB** provides a NoSQL database solution that efficiently stores property listings, user profiles, and interactions.

- **ORM and Database Access**: **Prisma** integrates with MongoDB to streamline database operations with an intuitive, type-safe API, making it easier to query and manage data.

- **Hosting**: The server is hosted on **Render.com**, which offers flexibility and scalability to handle increasing user traffic and API calls. The frontend, hosted on **Vercel**, ensures a high-performance, globally distributed app with minimal latency.

### Key Project Highlights

1. **Efficient Search and Filtering**: Buyers can search for properties using filters like location, price range, and property type. This feature is powered by Prisma’s optimized queries, which work seamlessly with MongoDB to return results quickly.

2. **User Authentication and Profiles**: Using a simple yet effective authentication system, users can create profiles, save favorite listings, and directly message property sellers, enhancing engagement and personalization.

3. **Robust Data Validation**: Zod ensures that user inputs are validated at both frontend and backend levels, reducing errors and ensuring reliable data flow across the application.

4. **Optimized Deployment**: Hosting the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render.com enables the app to deliver high-performance, scalable service to users around the globe.

Nest was made possible through strategic use of a modern tech stack and efficient deployment practices, ultimately providing a streamlined experience for connecting buyers with sellers.
